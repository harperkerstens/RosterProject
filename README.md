<h1>Lineup Logic </h1>
<h2>Created by Harper Kerstens</h2> 
<p>This project to help a team owner/coach manage his players and lineup for a respected sport with expandability at the forefront of the design. Created for a project during my time in second year I drew from my passion in sports to 
attempt to create something to combine two fields I love. The project allows you to create a team roster for either Hockey or Basketball which can be saved and worked with at a later time. You can add or change pivotal information to a player as well as the team such as players jersey number, minutes and more on the player specific side and who is starting for the team on the team side. </p>
